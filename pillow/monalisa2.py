from PIL import Image

# stratagies:
# 
# 1. read date from file
#       splitting on space, 
#       removing semicolon,
#       create new image
#       loop over lines with readln
#       for each value write pixel
#       
# 2. convert to list of lists
#       create new image
#       loop over x
#       loop over y
#       write pixel
#
# 3. convert to one list
#       convert list to bytes
#       create image at once w frombytes
